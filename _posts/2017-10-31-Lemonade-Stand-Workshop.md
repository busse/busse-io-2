title: API-first Redesign of a Legacy Application - Workshop
seq: 171030
category: Events
---

  - First Presented: [API Strat 2017](https://apistrat17.sched.com/event/f490266630e6b8ef151776c131c8ba17)
  - Presented January 16, 2018: [Innsbrook Software Development User Group, Richmond VA](https://www.meetup.com/Innsbrook-Software-Development-User-Group/events/245235993/)

> The classic text-based computer game "Lemonade Stand" was a favorite among elementary school students growing up in the 80s. It presented a simple model to teach business and economics. In this workshop we'll use it as the "legacy application" we've been asked by our client to turn into an API-first application.

> Starting with the overall taxonomy of the game and working our way down to the resource and payload level, we'll take a look at what needs to be represented in the game - from user inputs to IoT weather sensors - and define an API specification that could be used to faithfully recreate the logic from the original.

> This workshop will be both fun and educational. Participants will leave with a better appreciation of what it takes to reorganize real-world legacy applications into a RESTful model represented by an Open API Specification.
