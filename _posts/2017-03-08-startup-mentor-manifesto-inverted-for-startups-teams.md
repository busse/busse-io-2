title: The Startup Mentor Manifesto, Inverted for Startup Teams
seq: 170308
category: uncategorized
---

This post is a review of the Techstars [Mentor Manifesto](http://www.techstars.com/mentoringattechstars/), from an inverted perspective, to guide startup teams on how they should think about their relationship with mentors (especially during an accellerator program).

> This post was prepared as part of a talk I gave on March 8, 2016 at the VCU Startup Spring Break on "How to choose and work with a mentor". It is informed by over five years of mentoring startups during various accellerator programs as well as my professional experience as an entrepreneur and consultant. I maintain a collection of [startup mentoring-related links](https://pinboard.in/u:busse/t:mentoring/) as well.

The "key" for reading this post:

  - the original quoted lines from the Mentor Manifesto are *italicized* and not indented
  - my inversions for startups are the bulleted, indented items below them
  - after this list there are some subhead items - that is new/original material.

*Be socratic.*

  - Mentors ask a lot of questions, be prepared to engage them in healthy debate
  
*Expect nothing in return (you’ll be delighted with what you do get back).*

  - Beware the mentor who seems like they have an agenda
  - Beware the mentor who has a huge ego
  
*Be authentic / practice what you preach.*

  - Expect Authenticity
  - Be very wary if you smell BS

*Be direct. Tell the truth, however hard.*

  - If a mentor is sugar-coating what they tell you, then that isn’t helpful
  - There are no safe spaces in the startup world

*Listen too.*

  - Make sure you’re communicating with your mentor in a a way that is clear
  - Don’t be intimidated - be unafraid to get really explicit with them

*The best mentor relationships eventually become two-way.*

  - Mentors need feedback too!

*Be responsive.*

  - Expect the same level of responsiveness from your mentor as you would … a vendor?

*Adopt at least one company every single year. Experience counts.*

  - Seek a lead mentor
  - Don’t be afraid to switch lead mentors as your company grows and your needs fundamentally change - but be aware of the risk of losing their "institutional knowledge" -- this may take the form of more formal advisors or board members

*Clearly separate opinion from fact.*

  - Be aware of opinion vs fact
  - When giving an opinion, I tell the companies I’m working with: "This is just my opinion, feel free to completely disregard it as I'm sure I don't have all the variables you do"

*Hold information in confidence.*

  - Share as much as you possibly can so that your mentor has the complete picture
  - Exception: What are the mentor’s possible conflicts of interest?

*Clearly commit to mentor or do not. Either is fine.*

  - Seek explicit commitment
  - Expect committed behavior
  - Trust is established this way

*Know what you don’t know. Say I don’t know when you don’t know. “I don’t know” is preferable to bravado.*

  - Establish connections with a number of mentors, use the non-Lead mentors to fill in gaps of knowledge
  - Ask your mentor who they’d recommend, who they can make intros to? 
 
*Guide, don’t control. Teams must make their own decisions. Guide but never tell them what to do. Understand that it’s their company, not yours.*
 
  - You must never expect a mentor to be a decision maker for you or your company 
 
*Accept and communicate with other mentors that get involved.*

  - Often mentoring sessions are one-on-one, or the team with the mentor…
  - Share what other mentors have said to you, to get validation and/or different opinions
  - Let more than just the "CEO" communicate with the mentors - mentorship works best when the team gets exposure to the mentor

*Be optimistic.*

  - Expect Optimism!

*Provide specific actionable advice, don’t be vague.*

  - Drive your mentor to give you actionable advice
  - Don’t accept vagueness from them

*Be challenging/robust but never destructive.*

  - Expect to be challenged
  - Don’t allow yourself to be torn down - being mentored might be challenging, but it should never be toxic

*Have empathy. Remember that startups are hard.*

  - Mentors should know that startups are hard and have empathy for you

## Mentors talk among themselves about:

  - The general viability your product/company/team - especially if they’ve seen similar ideas before
  - **Your “coachability”**

## As a mentor, I want from my teams:

  - To display professionalism - my time is valuable, and this is a volunteer gig for me - please be on time and prepared for our meetings.
  - To show energy! However, I know that sometimes teams can get beat down, if I feel a lack of energy I may probe on that and see what’s up.
  - To keep me informed of their progress, during a program and after, even if we aren’t meeting regularly. I’ve invested my time and energy in a program, and when it’s over, I still care about you and your success.
