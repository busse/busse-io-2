In True At First Light, Ernest Hemingway describes his love for his (and Paris’s) “secret cafes”:

I imagine that in the time Hemingway describes, there were fewer vocations that could take advantage of this. A writer was clearly one. Today, so many of us are writers, whether it be email, PowerPoint, blogs, or code. We’ve seen the rise too of “third places” [xxx], many of which are “cafes” of some sort offering WiFi. At this point, they’re hardly new.

The concept of “secret cafes” really resonated with me. I know enough people in my local business community that I can pick pretty much any cafe in town and there’s a strong chance I’ll see someone I know when I glance around the dining room. (Validating this point, I saw two people I know when I sat down at a Panera to write the first draft of this post).

There is some research that shows why we often run into people we know [xxx] - sometimes even when traveling out of town. It has to do with xxx. Knowing a lot of people in town only multiplies that chance.

Sometimes though, I just want to be able to write and think as an anonymous diner - I want to find my own “secret cafe”.
