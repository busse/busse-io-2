In True At First Light, Ernest Hemingway describes his love for his (and Paris’s) “secret cafes”:

> xxx

I imagine that in the time Hemingway describes, there were fewer vocations that could take advantage of this. A writer was clearly one. Today, so many of us are writers, whether it be email, PowerPoint, blogs, or code. We’ve seen the rise too of “third places” [xxx], many of which are “cafes” of some sort offering WiFi. At this point, they’re hardly new.

The concept of “secret cafes” really resonated with me. I know enough people in my local business community that I can pick pretty much any cafe in town and there’s a strong chance I’ll see someone I know when I glance around the dining room. (Validating this point, I saw two people I know when I sat down at a Panera to write the first draft of this post).

There is some research that shows why we often run into people we know [xxx] - sometimes even when traveling out of town. It has to do with xxx. Knowing a lot of people in town only multiplies that chance.

Sometimes though, I just want to be able to write and think as an anonymous diner - I want to find my own “secret cafe”.

WHile I was sitting here someone just came up to the guy at the table behind me and was like hey man I just wanted to say hi - is this your home base now?

And he said yeah this is where I come to get work done, if I go in before 10am I just get pulled in to some many things!

To which is friend replied, haha, I’ll keep this secret!

Ok, a second guy in a suit just walked up to the guy sitting behind me and said “Throw you out of your office” - he relied, “haha this is my office”, the interloper said “haha you gotta hide!”, shook his hand said “good to see you” and then walked away to leave his colleague to work in peace.
