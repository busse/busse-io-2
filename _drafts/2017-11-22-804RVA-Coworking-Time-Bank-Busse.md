*This post is mostly for other members of the 804RVA Coworking space in Richmond, VA who are participating in the community Time Bank. However, maybe it's intriuging enough that you'd like to try a free day of coworking?*

804RVA has initiated a time bank - managed through the slack channel #timebank, modeled on the one in Cville [xxx]. In an effort to help build some momentum for the initiative, I’m offering the following services to the community, with the expectation that I’ll be “paid” by the time banked.

**Digital Marketing Strategy Workshops**

I helped launch and grow a multi-million dollar digital marketing agency that served small clients and Fortune 500 alike, I’ve served an adjunct instructor at the VCU Brandcenter - developing the curriculum for “Strategies of Modern Media” and “Brand Analytics”, and I launched a major new product initiative for a Fortune 500 company that was marketed heavily in digital. Through the course of that work I’ve developed two solid workshops that I’ve used with many groups, including several Lighthouse Labs teams over the five years I’ve volunteered as a mentor there. I have a passion for marketing, but it isn’t the main focus of what I’m doing professionally now so I’m making these workshops available to the 804RVA community.

***People, Product, Content, Context (PPCC) Workshop***

Regardless of size, all organizations have less resources to deploy in their marketing efforts than they’d like. One of the consequences of this is the need to focus on only the platforms that are likely to deliver the best return on investment.

This workshop was created to facilitate teams getting to that answer with confidence that they’re making the right choice.

Starting from a theory I developed while teaching Strategies of Modern media at the VCU Brandcenter, that “Platforms evolve, and with it people’s expectations of the content they are exposed to, as well as the context in which they are exposed”, in this workshop we’ll break down the four core elements that underpin every successful marketing initiative and arrive at solid conclusions that will enable you to move forward in your new marketing initiatives with confidence that you’re starting off in the right direction to make use of your limited resources.

**Time:** 1.5 - 2 hours
**Delivery:** In person, at a whiteboard 

*Note: Although I describe this as a “digital” marketing workshop, this will also work for offline platforms and channels if they’re in the mix of what you’re considering.*

***Building an effective paid media (pay-per-click) strategy workshop***

Google AdWords and other pay-per-click (PPC) platforms can be incredibly powerful traffic and revenue drivers. This holds especially true when you can mature your program to answer the all important question: “What is my predictable cost-per-acquisition?” — in other words, “If I spend X dollars, I’ll be confident that I can acquire Y new customers.”

This workshop assumes no background knowledge on how PPC advertising works, and takes you through the strategy behind developing great keyword-driven campaigns, backed by powerful, high-converting landing pages and the scientific method and discipline needed to build a strategy to launch PPC campaigns that drive real, predictable customer acquisition.

**Time:** 1.5 - 2 hours
**Delivery:** In person or remote via screen share

**Pitch Coaching & Feedback**

I’ve both seen and made over one hundred pitches for startups, marketing campaigns, products, data-driven initiatives, and all sorts of other random things. I can help you with whatever stage of development you’re in and work with you to get through as many iterations as you need to create a powerful pitch that gets your message across in an impactful way.

**Time:** 1+ hours
**Delivery:** Ideally in person, but remote via screen share is possible (and may be most appropriate if that’s how you deliver your pitch).

**Resume Review**

In the course of growing two companies and a team within the Fortune 500 that employed me, I’ve read over a thousand resumes and interviewed hundreds of people. Most people have bad resumes. Some of these are otherwise the best employees. The challenge is people can relate the work that they’ve done, but a hiring manager needs to get an idea of what you can do for them. I feel I have a pretty good eye for what makes a great resume and how to make it really stand out and would love to help you improve yours!

**Time:** 30 minutes
**Delivery:** You will email me a Word Doc or share a Google Doc of your resume and I will return or mark it up with Comments suggesting edits / improvements.

***Why no API / software development / technology strategy offerings for the time bank?***

That kind of work is what I do through my company [APIvista](http://APIvista.com) — if I’m treating the time bank like professional payment, then I also need to recognize that to offer services that overlap with my company would be a violation of my otherwise very liberal agreement with my business partners. If you’re in need of that kind of work, I’d love to talk about it, but it would need to be outside of the “time bank” context.
